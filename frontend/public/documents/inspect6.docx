This report documents the scheduled weekly maintenance inspection of Trainset KM05 conducted at Muttom Depot on 22 September 2025 from 08:00 to 14:00 hrs. The routine checklist covered critical sub-systems including bogies, traction motors, brake systems, HVAC, door mechanisms, and interior passenger facilities.

Observations:

1. Bogie Frame & Wheels: No visible cracks detected; wheel flange wear measured at 2.1 mm, within the 7 mm permissible limit.

2. Traction Motors: Surface temperature recorded at 62°C after trial run, acceptable under current standards. Lubricant levels adequate.

3. Braking System: Brake pad thickness measured at 8 mm, within safety margin. Air pressure valve functioning correctly.

4. HVAC Systems: Car 3 HVAC filter partially clogged; cleaning completed. Passenger temperature regulation stable during load test.

5. Interior Lighting: Car 2 interior lights near Door D2 flicker intermittently; electrical issue logged under Job Card #MNTC-4521 for corrective repair on 24 September.

6. Door Operations: All 12 doors functioned properly during repeated open/close cycles, no obstruction alarms.

Additional Actions: Trainset underwent bogie greasing and interior sanitization as per protocol. Abnormal bogie noise detected during low-speed maneuvering; preliminary cause linked to suspension bush wear. Monitoring recommended until replacement during next monthly inspection.
